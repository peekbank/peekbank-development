# peekbank-development

Developmental analyses of Peekbank data, corresponding to the paper "Continuous developmental changes in word recognition support language learning across early childhood". 

Reproducible paper materials are available in the `paper` directory. 

Sequential markdown files documenting exploratory data analysis for this project are documented in scripts prefixed `0_` through `5_`. Raw data caching in `get_data` can be somewhat time-consuming, but due to space limitations these files are not cached in the repository.
